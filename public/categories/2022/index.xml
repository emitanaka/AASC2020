      <description>The AASC conference is always a highlight for us at VSN, and it is a real disappointment that we cannot meet this year. Nevertheless it is good to be able to keep in touch by email, MS Teams and Zoom - and to know that you are keeping safe.
The Genstat team is dispersed over the two hemispheres, and so we are used to collaborating at a distance. Genstat development has continued almost unaffected, and I am glad to have this opportunity to tell you what we have been doing.</description>
