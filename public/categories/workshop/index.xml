      <description>Visualization and Data Mining Morning session: Sustenance for the every day statistical analysis This part covers making plots using the grammar of graphics and how this fits into statistical inference. We will use the tidyverse suite of packages and nullabor.
Afternoon session: Looking at the model in the data space This part will cover the use of tours to examine multivariate spaces, in relation to various data mining methods, including dimension reduction, supervised and unsupervised classification models.</description>

      <description>Genstat 20ed Masterclass: data mining and advanced modelling In this masterclass we will explore some of the data mining and more advanced statistical modelling facilities available in Genstat. As not all these facilities are available in the menus, the session will begin with a brief recap of Genstat’s command language.
Topics will include:
 Genstat command language data mining  association rules self-organising maps discriminant analysis support vector machines classification trees and random forests k-nearest-neighbours classification   advanced modelling  specialised regression (e.</description>

      <title>Workshop: Tidy Model Selection for PractioneRs</title>

      <description>Tidy Model Selection for PractioneRs Model selection is fundamental in many scientific fields for gaining insight into how response/s are informed by a set of measured predictors. This workshop focuses on two key aspects of the model selection routine for practitioners: (1) introducing and implementing a variety of model selection approaches including stepwise procedures, information criterion, and regularisation and screening methods for (generalised) linear models, and (2) constructing a reproducible and streamlined tidy workflow from data wrangling → model fitting and selection → reporting of results and evaluation of selection procedure/s as a whole.</description>
