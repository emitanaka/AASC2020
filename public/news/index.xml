      <description>ASReml and Genomic models Development of Genomic tools to support ASReml-R Genstat development in difficult times  ASReml and Genomic models Arthur R Gilmour
It is 50 years since Arthur began working as a biometrician with NSW DPI (1970) having majored in biometry in the 4th year of his B Sc AGr (Sydney). He wrote software for the group as well as analysing variety trials and consulting with research scientists.</description>

      <description>The AASC conference is always a highlight for us at VSN, and it is a real disappointment that we cannot meet this year. Nevertheless it is good to be able to keep in touch by email, MS Teams and Zoom - and to know that you are keeping safe.
The Genstat team is dispersed over the two hemispheres, and so we are used to collaborating at a distance. Genstat development has continued almost unaffected, and I am glad to have this opportunity to tell you what we have been doing.</description>

      <description>ASReML in Practice Biography: Arthur Gilmour obtained his B Sc Agr from Sydney University majoring in Biometry in 1970 with a NSW Government traineeship. He then served as a biometrician until his retirement from NSW Agriculture as a Principal Research Scientist in 2009. From the outset, he was involved in software development to meet the current statistical analysis needs of his clients and colleagues. He obtained his PhD in animal breeding from Massey University in 1983 during which time he came into contact with Robin Thompson.</description>

      <description>Visualization and Data Mining Morning session: Sustenance for the every day statistical analysis This part covers making plots using the grammar of graphics and how this fits into statistical inference. We will use the tidyverse suite of packages and nullabor.
Afternoon session: Looking at the model in the data space This part will cover the use of tours to examine multivariate spaces, in relation to various data mining methods, including dimension reduction, supervised and unsupervised classification models.</description>

      <description>Genstat 20ed Masterclass: data mining and advanced modelling In this masterclass we will explore some of the data mining and more advanced statistical modelling facilities available in Genstat. As not all these facilities are available in the menus, the session will begin with a brief recap of Genstat’s command language.
Topics will include:
 Genstat command language data mining  association rules self-organising maps discriminant analysis support vector machines classification trees and random forests k-nearest-neighbours classification   advanced modelling  specialised regression (e.</description>

      <title>Workshop: Tidy Model Selection for PractioneRs</title>
      <link>https://aasc2020.netlify.com/news/workshop-tidy-model-selection-for-practioners/</link>

      <description>Tidy Model Selection for PractioneRs Model selection is fundamental in many scientific fields for gaining insight into how response/s are informed by a set of measured predictors. This workshop focuses on two key aspects of the model selection routine for practitioners: (1) introducing and implementing a variety of model selection approaches including stepwise procedures, information criterion, and regularisation and screening methods for (generalised) linear models, and (2) constructing a reproducible and streamlined tidy workflow from data wrangling → model fitting and selection → reporting of results and evaluation of selection procedure/s as a whole.</description>
