      <title>Workshop: Data Visualisation with R</title>
      <link>https://aasc2022.netlify.com/news/workshop-datavis/</link>

      <description>Data Visualisation with R Data visualisation is a key statistical tool for effective communication and to understand aspects of data and models. The statistical language R is used widely for data analysis and visualization, e.g. the BBC Visual and Data Journalism team uses ggplot2 R-package to create production-ready charts. This workshop will teach you how to create production-ready graphics using the grammar of graphics implemented in ggplot2 R-package. The workshop will be hands-on with plenty of practical examples.</description>

      <description>The AASC conference is always a highlight for us at VSN, and it is a real disappointment that we cannot meet this year. Nevertheless it is good to be able to keep in touch by email, MS Teams and Zoom - and to know that you are keeping safe.
The Genstat team is dispersed over the two hemispheres, and so we are used to collaborating at a distance. Genstat development has continued almost unaffected, and I am glad to have this opportunity to tell you what we have been doing.</description>

      <description>ASReML in Practice Biography: Arthur Gilmour obtained his B Sc Agr from Sydney University majoring in Biometry in 1970 with a NSW Government traineeship. He then served as a biometrician until his retirement from NSW Agriculture as a Principal Research Scientist in 2009. From the outset, he was involved in software development to meet the current statistical analysis needs of his clients and colleagues. He obtained his PhD in animal breeding from Massey University in 1983 during which time he came into contact with Robin Thompson.</description>

      <description>[This workshop is now cancelled]{style=&amp;ldquo;color:red;&amp;quot;} and replaced with Data Visualisation with R.
Visualization and Data Mining Morning session: Sustenance for the every day statistical analysis This part covers making plots using the grammar of graphics and how this fits into statistical inference. We will use the tidyverse suite of packages and nullabor.
Afternoon session: Looking at the model in the data space This part will cover the use of tours to examine multivariate spaces, in relation to various data mining methods, including dimension reduction, supervised and unsupervised classification models.</description>

As not all these facilities are available in the menus, the session will begin with a brief recap of Genstat‚Äôs command language.
Topics will include:
 Genstat command language Data mining  association rules self-organising maps discriminant analysis support vector machines classification trees and random forests k-nearest-neighbours classification   Advanced modelling  specialised regression (e.</description>
