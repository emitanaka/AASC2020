      <description>Tidy Model Selection for PractioneRs Model selection is fundamental in many scientific fields for gaining insight into how response/s are informed by a set of measured predictors. This workshop focuses on two key aspects of the model selection routine for practitioners: (1) introducing and implementing a variety of model selection approaches including stepwise procedures, information criterion, and regularisation and screening methods for (generalised) linear models, and (2) constructing a reproducible and streamlined tidy workflow from data wrangling → model fitting and selection → reporting of results and evaluation of selection procedure/s as a whole.</description>
