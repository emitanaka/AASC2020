                    We are pleased to invite you to Victoria for the Australasian Applied Statistics Conference 2022 (AASC2022) to be held between the 29/11/2022 to the 2/12/2022 at the <a href="https://www.racv.com.au/travel-leisure/racv-resorts/our-destinations/inverloch-resort/facilities.html  ">RACV Inverloch Resort</a> in the heart of the South Gippsland Coast, on the edge of the Bunurong Marine and Coastal Park, and in reach of Wilsons Promontory and Philip Island. The conference will provide you with the opportunity to liaise with fellow statisticians within the agricultural, biological and environmental sciences and to keep abreast of the most recent developments in statistics within this area. This conference is in the series, originating with the initial Australasian Genstat conference in Canberra in 1979.  The Genstat conference changed to the Australasian Applied Statistics Conference in 2011 to encompass the wider community of applied statisticians, and AASC conferences have been held in Palm Cove (Aus), Queenstown (NZ), Port Lincoln (Aus), Bermagui (Aus) and Rotorua (NZ).

One of the positive things of the conference is that itâ€™s not too large, so that you can meet most people, and we hope you will make new friends and opportunities for collaboration. The themes of AASC2022 are (but not limited to) data visualization, data mining, deep learning for prediction and forecasting, ASReml in practice, and model selection for practitioners, as well as covering developments in Genstat. Our exciting group of invited speakers and workshop presenters (Patricia Menendez, Carolyn Huston, Francis Hui, Emi Tanaka, Roger Payne, Vanessa Cave, David Baird, Emlyn Williams, and Arthur Gilmour) will help explore these themes in various contexts.
