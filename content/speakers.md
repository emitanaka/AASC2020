## ASReML in Practice

<img src="/img/speakers/arthur.jpg" width="200px"/>

### Biography:

Arthur Gilmour obtained his B Sc Agr from Sydney University majoring in Biometry in 1970 with a NSW Government traineeship.  He then served as a biometrician until his retirement from NSW Agriculture as a Principal Research Scientist in 2009.  From the outset, he was involved in software development to meet the current statistical analysis needs of his clients and colleagues.  He obtained his PhD in animal breeding from Massey University in 1983 during which time he came into contact with Robin Thompson.  This led to a collaboration, also involving Brian Cullis, resulting in the development of ASReml in 1996.  He continues to support and develop ASReml and is in regular contact with Robin.

### Talk Overview:

The linear mixed model has proved a very useful tool for data analysis, especially in the contexts of plant and animal breeding, agricultural experimentation and data exploration.  The design of ASReml allows it to fit a large range of linear mixed models in a variety of contexts.  The key features are the use of various correlation structures, use of direct product variance structures and sparse computing methods facilitating the fitting of large models.  The linear mixed model has been extended to generalised linear mixed models and hierarchal generalised linear mixed models.  The paper will outline the joint model of mean and dispersion.  


## Deep Learning for prediction and forecasting of Agricultural processes

<img src="/img/speakers/petra_2019_crop.jpg" width="200px"/>

### Biography:

Petra is a Research Statistician in CSIRO’s Data61. She has a PhD in applied statistics, focussing more recently on hybrid prediction approaches that utilise machine learning and deep learning methods. She has an interest in spatio-temporal modelling and developing methods for uncertainty quantification and visualisation to aid decision-making.

Petra is the Activity Leader for the Hybrid Prediction Activity in the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (MLAI) Future Science Platform (FSP) within CSIRO, where the focus is on re-imagining complex and constrained biogeophysical processes with MLAI to support decision-making. She is also leading a team within the Digiscape FSP, focussing on developing an uncertainty toolbox, an open source tool to assist with uncertainty quantification and visualisation. 



### Talk Overview:

Over the past decade, agricultural practices have been disrupted by the next generation of decision support tools.  The development of new high-tech machinery, analytics operating in the Cloud, and cheap sensors that capture large volumes of information in space and time have resulted in challenges for the decision-makers in determining how best to manage their farm.

The development of new analytics for decision-making is driven by the need to better quantify predictions and forecasts of agricultural systems in space and time given a range of very large and complex datasets and under a range of modelling paradigms.   While there are a number of analytical approaches being proposed, very few properly take into account uncertainty in all aspects of an agricultural system and furthermore, even fewer, take uncertainty into account in decision-making practices.

In this talk, I will explore deep learning as a tool for learning complex and non-linear agricultural processes in space and time and how uncertainty can be tackled in this framework to accompany predictions from these models.  I will compare these methods with machine learning approaches like Random Forests and other more traditional approaches for modelling crop yields and comment on the use of deep learning practices for the future.  


## All Under One Roof – The Rise of Joint Species Distribution Modeling in Ecology

<img src="/img/speakers/francis.jpg" width="200px"/>

### Biography:

Francis Hui is a Senior Lecturer in Statistics at the Australian National University. Having completed his PhD
at the University of New South Wales in 2014, Francis moved to Canberra to undertake a postdoctoral
fellowship at the ANU, and has been willingly stuck there since. His research spans a mixture of
methodological, computational, and applied statistics, including longitudinal and correlated data analysis
using mixed and/or marginal models, dimension reduction and variable selection, and approximate statistical
estimation and inference. Much of his applications are motivated by joint modeling in community ecology,
and temporal analysis of social and environmental drivers for mental health. All of his research is
complemented by copious amounts of tea drinking and unhealthy amounts of anime watching.

### Talk Overview:

Prompted by improvements in computing power and an increasing number of scientific questions that are
multi-response in nature, the landscape of statistical analysis in community ecology has undergone a major
shift in the last five years with the explosion of joint species distribution modeling. In this talk, I will provide an
overview of how such models (which are largely based around the use of latent variables or some variation
thereof) have come to dominate the discipline, and how they have been adapted to solve questions by
ecologists regarding the environmental and biotic processes driving species assemblages. I will then offer an
(opinionated) view of where-to-next for joint species distribution models, including the use of “modern”
statistical approaches such as covariance/correlation regression and spatio-temporal methods, and the
growing software market. Finally, I will discuss related research opportunities across other disciplines where
latent variable models are applied, such as in the analysis of multi-environmental field trials in plant breeding.


## Data visualisation: Bridging the long-standing gap between exploratory and inferential statistics

<img src="/img/speakers/dicook-2019.png" width="200px"/>


### Biography:

Dianne Cook is Professor of Business Analytics at Monash University in
Melbourne, Australia.  She is a world leader in data visualisation,
especially the visualisation of high-dimensional data using tours with
low-dimensional projections, and projection pursuit.  She is currently
focussing on bridging the gap between exploratory graphics and
statistical inference. It is sometimes said that she is more famous
for the students who have emerged from her group, including  Hadley
Wickham, Yihui Xie, Carson Sievert, and most recently, Monash student
Earo Wang. Di is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, was
recently the editor of the Journal of Computational and Graphical
Statistics, an elected Ordinary Member of the R Foundation, and
elected member of the International Statistical Institute.

### Talk Overview:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model diagnostics (MD) are two data analytic activities that rely primarily on visual displays and only secondarily on numerical summaries. Roughly speaking, we may associate EDA with what we do to raw data before we fit a complex model and MD with what we do to transformed data after we fit a model. EDA, more so than MD, has sometimes received an ambivalent response. When seen positively, it is cast as an exciting part of statistics that has to do with ‘discovery’ and ‘detective work’; when seen negatively, EDA is cast as the part of statistics that results in unsecured findings at best, and in the over- or misinterpretation of data at worst. Either way, EDA seems to be lacking something: discoveries need to be confirmed and over-interpretations of data need to be prevented.  The mirror image of EDA’s and MD’s inferential failings is confirmatory statistics’ potential failure to find the obvious. When subordinating common sense to rigid testing protocols for the sake of valid inference, confirmatory data analysis risks using tests and confidence intervals in assumed models that should never have been fitted, when EDA before, or MD after, fitting could have revealed that the approach to the data is flawed and the structure of the data required altogether different methods.

This talk will discuss new thinking that incorporates data visualisation into the inferential framework. This brings statistics close to the field of data science, making it easier for statisticians to be explorers and discoverers, as well as skeptics.
