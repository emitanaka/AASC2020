<h3>While registering, accept AGUAi membership</h3>

Despite its name, the Australasian Genstat Users Association Inc (AGUAi) exists specifically to organize this biennial conference. As you register for the conference, please accept free membership. You will then be placed on the conference email list to stay informed about future AASConferences and be eligible to vote on who gets to organise the next AASC. For historical reasons the formal objectives of the association are: 


*	to foster association between persons involved or interested in using Genstat 
*	to foster association between persons involved or interested in the application of statistical methods 
*	to organise meetings and events focussed on statistical and statistical computing issues. 

The Rules of Association are available <a href="../files/AGUAi_rules_of_Association_2019.pdf" download>here</a>.


<h3>Travel insurance</h3>

We recommend you to get travel insurance.

<h3>Book accommodation while you can</h3>

Delegates are recommended to book accommodation early in order to get their preferred option. Room availability is limited and, as we move closer to the conference date, RACV will be taking non-conference accommodation bookings from the public. Accommodation elsewhere in Inverloch is likely to involve a daily ~5km commute to the conference venue.
