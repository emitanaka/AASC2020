## Genstat 20ed Masterclass: data mining and advanced modelling

In this masterclass we will explore some of the data mining and more advanced statistical modelling facilities available in Genstat. As not all these facilities are available in the menus, the session will begin with a brief recap of Genstat’s command language.

Topics will include:
* **Genstat command language**
* **data mining**
  * association rules
  * self-organising maps
  * discriminant analysis
  * support vector machines
  * classification trees and random forests
  * $k$-nearest-neighbours classification
* **advanced modelling**
  * specialised regression (e.g. lasso, quantile regression)
  * comparisons and contrasts in regression and REML
  *GLMMs and HGLMs - how do they differ and what are their advantages/disadvantages?
  *new facilities for assessing fixed models in REML
  *generating reports and exporting results (i.e. interoperability)
  
The sessions will involve a mixture of examples and practicals, so please bring your laptops (ideally with Genstat 20ed already installed).


## Biography of Workshop Presenters

**Roger Payne** leads the development of Genstat at VSN, now working part-time after 15 years in the
full-time role of VSN&#39;s Chief Science and Technology Officer. He has a degree in Mathematics and a
PhD in Mathematical Statistics from University of Cambridge and is a Chartered Statistician of the
Royal Statistical Society. Prior to joining VSN, Roger was a statistical consultant and researcher at
Rothamsted, becoming their expert on design and analysis of experiments, as well as leader of their
statistical computing activities. He originally took over the leadership of Genstat there in 1985 when
John Nelder retired. His other statistical interests include generalized and hierarchical generalized
linear models, linear mixed models, the study of efficient identification methods (with applications in
particular to the identification of yeasts). Roger&#39;s statistical research has resulted in 9 books with
commercial publishers, as well as over 100 scientific papers. He has a visiting professorship at
Liverpool John Moores University, and also retains an honorary position at Rothamsted, to help him
keep in touch with practical statistics.

**David Baird** is a consultant statistician with 35-years’ experience and has been a Genstat developer
for 25 years. He was a biometrician at AgResearch for 25 years before starting his own company VSN
NZ. He has worked in a wide range of disciplines including biosecurity, entomology, agriculture,
ecology, soil science, plant breeding and microarrays. His statistical interests include experimental
design, spatial analysis, data mining and statistical modelling. For the last 9 years he has been the NZ
Earthquakes Commission’s statistical consultant. In 2019 he was awarded an ALF Cornish award for
contributions to biometrics in Australasia. David has a MSc in Applied Statistics from the University
of Reading and a PhD in Statistics from the University of Otago.

**Vanessa Cave** is a Team Leader of Statistics in the Bioinformatics and Statistics Group at
AgResearch, and a longer-time user and now developer of the Genstat statistical package. She has
many years’ experience collaborating with scientists in the agricultural and environmental sciences,
using statistics to solve real-world problems. As a biometrician, Vanessa provides expertise on
experiment and survey design, data collection and management, statistical analysis, and the
interpretation of statistical findings. Vanessa is also an active member of the Australasian statistical
community, serving on the New Zealand Statistical Association committee and president-elect of the
Australasian Region of the International Biometric Society. She is also an editorial board member for
New Zealand Veterinary Journal and an associate editor for Agronomy Journal. Vanessa has an
honours degree in Statistics from the University of Otago and a PhD in Statistics from the University
of St Andrews.
