## Improving predictions by integrating Data Science and Domain Science in Resources and the Environment

Over the last decade there has been a rush to use Data Science applications in areas such as Geology, Ecology and Hydrology. However, in many cases this has either been a relatively limited application of Data Science tools within a complex Domain Science problem, or a more theoretical Data Science approach on a very limited Domain Science problem. In other words, in most cases the Domains simply borrow techniques or problems. This can be seen as a relatively weak integration of the two domains. This session seeks contributions of examples of strong integration, where problems of Data Science and Domain Science are co-developed or are working towards co-developed problems. Contributions highlighting issues and barriers related to such co-development are also encouraged.
