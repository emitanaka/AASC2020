## Data visualisation: Bridging the long-standing gap between exploratory and inferential statistics

<img src="/img/speakers/dicook-2019.png" width="200px"/>


### Biography:

Dianne Cook is Professor of Business Analytics at Monash University in
Melbourne, Australia.  She is a world leader in data visualisation,
especially the visualisation of high-dimensional data using tours with
low-dimensional projections, and projection pursuit.  She is currently
focussing on bridging the gap between exploratory graphics and
statistical inference. It is sometimes said that she is more famous
for the students who have emerged from her group, including  Hadley
Wickham, Yihui Xie, Carson Sievert, and most recently, Monash student
Earo Wang. Di is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, was
recently the editor of the Journal of Computational and Graphical
Statistics, an elected Ordinary Member of the R Foundation, and
elected member of the International Statistical Institute.

### Talk Overview:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model diagnostics (MD) are two data analytic activities that rely primarily on visual displays and only secondarily on numerical summaries. Roughly speaking, we may associate EDA with what we do to raw data before we fit a complex model and MD with what we do to transformed data after we fit a model. EDA, more so than MD, has sometimes received an ambivalent response. When seen positively, it is cast as an exciting part of statistics that has to do with ‘discovery’ and ‘detective work’; when seen negatively, EDA is cast as the part of statistics that results in unsecured findings at best, and in the over- or misinterpretation of data at worst. Either way, EDA seems to be lacking something: discoveries need to be confirmed and over-interpretations of data need to be prevented.  The mirror image of EDA’s and MD’s inferential failings is confirmatory statistics’ potential failure to find the obvious. When subordinating common sense to rigid testing protocols for the sake of valid inference, confirmatory data analysis risks using tests and confidence intervals in assumed models that should never have been fitted, when EDA before, or MD after, fitting could have revealed that the approach to the data is flawed and the structure of the data required altogether different methods.

This talk will discuss new thinking that incorporates data visualisation into the inferential framework. This brings statistics close to the field of data science, making it easier for statisticians to be explorers and discoverers, as well as skeptics.
