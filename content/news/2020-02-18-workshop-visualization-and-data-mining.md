[This workshop is now cancelled]{style="color:red;"} and replaced with Data Visualisation with R. 

## Visualization and Data Mining

### Morning session: Sustenance for the every day statistical analysis

This part covers making plots using the grammar of graphics and how this fits into statistical inference. We will use the tidyverse suite of packages and nullabor.

### Afternoon session: Looking at the model in the data space

This part will cover the use of tours to examine multivariate spaces, in relation to various data mining methods, including dimension reduction, supervised and unsupervised classification models. The tourr and spinifex packages will be used.

### Pre-requisites and recommended reading:

- A basic knowledge of R would be useful
- Read/flip through the
    - chapter on visualisation in R for Data Science (https://r4ds.had.co.nz)
    - Graphical Inference for InfoVis (http://had.co.nz/stat645/graphical-inference.pdf)
    - tourr: An R Package for Exploring Multivariate Data with Projections (https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i02)
    - Visualizing statistical models: Removing the blindfold (https://github.com/dicook/paper-model-vis/blob/master/model-vis.pdf

Hands-on, bring your own laptop with R and the packages loaded.

### Biography of Workshop Presenter

Dianne Cook is Professor of Business Analytics at Monash University in
Melbourne, Australia.  She is a world leader in data visualisation,
especially the visualisation of high-dimensional data using tours with
low-dimensional projections, and projection pursuit.  She is currently
focussing on bridging the gap between exploratory graphics and
statistical inference. It is sometimes said that she is more famous
for the students who have emerged from her group, including  Hadley
Wickham, Yihui Xie, Carson Sievert, and most recently, Monash student
Earo Wang. Di is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, was
recently the editor of the Journal of Computational and Graphical
Statistics, an elected Ordinary Member of the R Foundation, and
elected member of the International Statistical Institute.
