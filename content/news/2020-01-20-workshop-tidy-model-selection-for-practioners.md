## Tidy Model Selection for PractioneRs

Model selection is fundamental in many scientific fields for gaining insight into how response/s are informed
by a set of measured predictors. This workshop focuses on two key aspects of the model selection routine
for practitioners: (1) introducing and implementing a variety of model selection approaches including
stepwise procedures, information criterion, and regularisation and screening methods for (generalised) linear
models, and (2) constructing a reproducible and streamlined tidy workflow from data wrangling → model
fitting and selection → reporting of results and evaluation of selection procedure/s as a whole. The workshop
will be based on the cross-platform, open-source software R, integrating recent advancements such as
tidyverse and R Markdown with particular attention to the subtleties of the model selection process.

The workshop will be very much hands-on: less attention will be given to the theoretical underpinnings of the
methods, while opportunities will be maximized for participants to practice the model selection routine on
data motivated by ecological and agricultural studies.

## Requirements

Workshop participants will be required to be proficient in basic R and have a working knowledge of linear
models. Workshop participants will be required to bring their own laptop and can connect to the internet
wirelessly.


## Biography of Workshop Presenters

Francis Hui is a Senior Lecturer in Statistics at the Australian National University. His research spans a
mixture of methodological, computational, and applied statistics, including a number of publications on model
selection in top statistical and applied ecology journals. He has taught a number of courses and workshops
relating to model selection and R to university students and ecological scientists.

Emi Tanaka is a Lecturer in Statistics at Monash University. Her research focuses on statistical methods
motivated in particular by bioinformatics and agriculture. She is an experienced and enthusiastic R user and
instructor. She teaches model selection and R regularly to university students and has taught several R
workshops on modern programming, such as Tidyverse, Blogdown, Shiny and R Markdown.
