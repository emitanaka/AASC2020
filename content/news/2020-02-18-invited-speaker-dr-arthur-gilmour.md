## ASReML in Practice

<img src="/img/speakers/arthur.jpg" width="200px"/>

### Biography:

Arthur Gilmour obtained his B Sc Agr from Sydney University majoring in Biometry in 1970 with a NSW Government traineeship.  He then served as a biometrician until his retirement from NSW Agriculture as a Principal Research Scientist in 2009.  From the outset, he was involved in software development to meet the current statistical analysis needs of his clients and colleagues.  He obtained his PhD in animal breeding from Massey University in 1983 during which time he came into contact with Robin Thompson.  This led to a collaboration, also involving Brian Cullis, resulting in the development of ASReml in 1996.  He continues to support and develop ASReml and is in regular contact with Robin.

### Talk Overview:

The linear mixed model has proved a very useful tool for data analysis, especially in the contexts of plant and animal breeding, agricultural experimentation and data exploration.  The design of ASReml allows it to fit a large range of linear mixed models in a variety of contexts.  The key features are the use of various correlation structures, use of direct product variance structures and sparse computing methods facilitating the fitting of large models.  The linear mixed model has been extended to generalised linear mixed models and hierarchal generalised linear mixed models.  The paper will outline the joint model of mean and dispersion.
