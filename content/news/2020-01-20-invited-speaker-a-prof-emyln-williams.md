## The application of CycDesigN in designing experiments for use in agriculture

CycDesigN version 7.0 (CD7) has extensive features for the design of field and glasshouse
experiments, including plant phenotyping. This talk will focus on the substantial new facilities
available in CD7, in particular neighbour balance and evenness of distribution (NB &amp; ED) designs as
applied to resolvable, non-resolvable, single and multi-location partially replicated designs. A
number of examples will be presented.
