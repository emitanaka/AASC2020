## Deep Learning for prediction and forecasting of Agricultural processes

### Biography:

Petra is a Research Statistician in CSIROâ€™s Data61. She has a PhD in applied statistics, focussing more recently on hybrid prediction approaches that utilise machine learning and deep learning methods. She has an interest in spatio-temporal modelling and developing methods for uncertainty quantification and visualisation to aid decision-making.

Petra is the Activity Leader for the Hybrid Prediction Activity in the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (MLAI) Future Science Platform (FSP) within CSIRO, where the focus is on re-imagining complex and constrained biogeophysical processes with MLAI to support decision-making. She is also leading a team within the Digiscape FSP, focussing on developing an uncertainty toolbox, an open source tool to assist with uncertainty quantification and visualisation. 



### Talk Overview:

Over the past decade, agricultural practices have been disrupted by the next generation of decision support tools.  The development of new high-tech machinery, analytics operating in the Cloud, and cheap sensors that capture large volumes of information in space and time have resulted in challenges for the decision-makers in determining how best to manage their farm.

The development of new analytics for decision-making is driven by the need to better quantify predictions and forecasts of agricultural systems in space and time given a range of very large and complex datasets and under a range of modelling paradigms.   While there are a number of analytical approaches being proposed, very few properly take into account uncertainty in all aspects of an agricultural system and furthermore, even fewer, take uncertainty into account in decision-making practices.

In this talk, I will explore deep learning as a tool for learning complex and non-linear agricultural processes in space and time and how uncertainty can be tackled in this framework to accompany predictions from these models.  I will compare these methods with machine learning approaches like Random Forests and other more traditional approaches for modelling crop yields and comment on the use of deep learning practices for the future.
